Transition: 'But how do summaries actually reach the model?'\n2. Show the assembler constructing the context array: evictable prefix (summaries filling a token budget oldest-to-newest) + protected fresh tail (raw messages always appended unconditionally)\n3. Visualize the budget bar filling — summary tokens vs fresh tail tokens locked on the other end\n4. Key insight: the model never sees raw past messages, only summary tokens — but the fresh tail is always verbatim\n5. When summaries overflow the budget, oldest summaries are dropped from context (but remain in the DAG, still accessible via expand_query)\n\nVisuals needed:\n- Assembler sequence animation — items populating the model's message array in order\n- Budget split: summary portion fills left-to-right, fresh tail portion anchored on right\n- Reuses existing ContextPanel, message/summary item primitives\n\nSource: architecture.md 'Context assembly' section","priority":"2","title":"Section A: Context Assembly scrollytelling","type":"task"}}

User pastes a large file (log, codebase, etc.) into the conversation\n2. At ingestion, LCM detects it exceeds the largeFileTokenThreshold (25k tokens)\n3. Animation: the file block shrinks/extracts — content stored externally, replaced with a compact reference stub in the message\n4. Conversation continues normally; the stub is tiny\n5. Later, the agent needs the file — calls lcm_describe(id: 'file_xxx')\n6. Full file content returned; agent has what it needs without having consumed context budget\n\nVisuals needed:\n- File block component (new) — large, then animates to stub reference card\n- Storage indicator (file stored externally)\n- lcm_describe retrieval showing file metadata + content\n\nSource: architecture.md 'Large file handling' section","priority":"2","title":"Section B: Large File Handling scrollytelling","type":"task"}}

Show depth-2 node forming — more abstract, more durable, covering weeks of arc\n4. Fresh tail always present; the model can reach any historical detail via expand_query\n5.
